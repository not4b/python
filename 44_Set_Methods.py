# Set Methods 
# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on sets. 

# 01. add() - Adds an element to the set

# Python Set add() Method
# Add an element to the fruits set: 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.add("orange")
print(fruits)

# Definition and Usage 
# The add() method adds an element to the set. 
# If the element already exists, the add() method does not add the element. 

# Syntax
# set.add(elmnt)

# Parameter Values 
# elmnt - Required. The element add to the set

# More Examples 
# Try to add an element that already exists: 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.add("apple")
print(fruits)

# 02. clear()  -    Removes an element to the set
# Python Set clear() Method
# Remove all elements from the fruits set: 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)

# Definition and Usage 
# The clear() Method removes all elements in a set. 

# Syntax 
# set.clear() 

# Parameter Values
# No parameters

# 03. copy() - Returns a copy of the set
# Python Set copy() Method

# Copy the fruits set: 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
x = fruits.copy()
print(x)

# Definition and Usage 
# The copy() method copies a set. 
# set.copy()

# Parameter Values
# No parameters 

# 04. difference()  - Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets 
# Python Set difference() Method
# Return a set that contains the items that only exist in set x, and not in set y ; 
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = y.difference(x)
print(z)

# Definition and Usage
# The differnce() method returns a set that contains the difference between two sets. 
# Meaning: The returned set contains items that exist only in the first set, and not in both sets. 

# Syntax 
# set.difference(set)

# Parameter Values 
# set - Required. The set to check for differences in 

# More Examples
# Reverse the first example. Return a set that contains the items that only exist in set y , and not in set x : 

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
z = x.difference(y)
print(z)

# 05. difference_update() - Removes the items in this set that are also include in another, specified set 
# Python Set difference_update() Method
# Remove the items that exist in both sets: 
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.difference_update(y)
print(x)

# Definition and Usage 
# The differnce_update() method removes the items that exist in both sets. 
# The difference_update() method is different from the difference() method, because the difference() method returns a new set, without the unwanted items, and the difference_update() method removes the unwanted items from the original set. 

# set.diifernce_update(set)

# Parameter Values 
# set -  Required. The set to check for differnces in 

# 06. discard() - Removes the specified item 
# Python Set discard() Method
# Remove "banana" from the set: 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.discard("banana")
print(fruits)

# Definition and Usage 
# The discard() Method removes the specified item from the set. 
# This method is different from the remove() method, because the remove() method will raise an error if the specified item does not exist, and the discard() method will not.

# Syntax
# set.discard(value)

# Parameter Values
# value - Required. The item to search for, and remove

print(z)

# Definition and usage 
# The intersection() method returns a set that conatains the similarity between two or more sets. 
# Meaning: The returned set contains ony items that exist in both sets, or in all sets if the comparison is done with more than two sets.

x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = {"c", "d", "e"}
z = {"f", "g", "c"}
result = x.intersection(y, z)
print(result)

x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.intersection_update(y)
print(x)

# Definition and Usage 
# The intersection_update() method removes the items that is not present in both (or in all sets if the comparison is done between more than two sets).
# The intersection_update() method is different from the intersection() method, because the intersection() method returns a new set, without the unwanted items, and the intersection_update() removes the unwanted items the original set. 

# Syntax 
# set.intersection_update(set1, set2, ... etc)

# Parameter Values 
# set1 - Required. The set to reach for equal items in 
# set2 - Optional. The other set to search for equal in. You can compare as many sets you like. Separate the sets with a comma. 

# More Examples
