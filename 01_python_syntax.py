# Execute Python Syntax 
# As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the command line:
print("Hello World!")

# Python Indentation 

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")

    # Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation

# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")

if 9 > 4:
        print("Nine is always greater than four!")

# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

# if 5 > 2:
#     print("Five is greater than two")
#         print("Two is smaller than five")

# Python Variables 
# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

# variables in python
x = 5
y = "hello, world!"

# Python has no command for declaring a variable .
# You will learn about variables in Python Variables Chapeter.

#  Comments 
# Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

#  Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of line as a comment:

# This is a comment 
print("Hello World")
